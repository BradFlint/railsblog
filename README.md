Basic blogging app built in Rails.

There should be a User, Post, and Comment model.

The app should has a similar functionality to Tumblr - users can login, write posts, comment on other users' posts, etc.

User goes to local host 3000 to create an account. 
After creating an account user is automatically logged in. From there, the user has the
ability to create a new post, view all posts, comment on a post, follow a user,
unfollow a user and delete posts and comments.

There is a profile page with the users "Friends" and the option to edit account, create
a post, see all users ect.

The all users page shows all of the users who have created an account with a button
allowing the current user to follow another user by clicking the button.

The all post page has all of the posts that have been created. Click on the 
post to post a comment to the post and to see all of the previous comments to that post.
